  DigiShow RIOC
  Remote IO Control for Arduino

  Copyright 2016-2025 Robin Zhang & Labs
  https://github.com/robinz-labs/digishow-rioc

  version 0.51
  compatible with digishow 1.6

  This program has been tested with Arduino UNO, Duemilanove, Nano, MEGA and DUE. 
  This version is also partially compatible with some other types of boards, 
  such as ESP32 and RP2040.

  Normally you don't need to edit this file, and you just upload this sketch program 
  to your Arduino. Then through the USB serial port, the DigiShow app can remotely 
  control the sensors and actuators connected to the IO pins on the Arduino board.
