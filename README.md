# rioc-arduino

RIOC is an acronym for Remote IO Control. rioc-arduino is an Arduino sketch program that enables Arduino IO pins to be reconfigurable and controllable by remote apps like h5control or DigiShow LINK. 

rioc-arduino is able to configure and drive your Arduino units to be parts in a simple controller network using USB for controlling digital/analog IO, motors, servos, LED lights, sensors etc.


## How to make a remote-controlled Arduino with RIOC ?

1. Need an Arduino MEGA or UNO, Nano board.

2. Open sketch RiocArduino.ino in Arduino IDE and upload the program to the Arduino.
